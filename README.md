This project's purpose is to test our ability to program in C. In this project, we recreated the classic game Minesweeper, written entirely in C. 

How to use it:
1. First, compile the C files by running 'make' on the terminal command line.
2. Then, run the executable './gameboard' to start the game.
3. Follow the directions written onto the command line.
